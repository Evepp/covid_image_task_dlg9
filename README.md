#Enhancing Chest X-ray Image Classification for COVID-19 Detection Using CNN and Transfer Learning Techniques

he project aims to enhance the accuracy of classifying chest X-ray images into four categories: Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia, No Pneumonia, and COVID-19, using a dataset of 6500 images. The preprocessing involves resizing, normalizing, and one-hot encoding the data, followed by stratified splitting into training, validation, and test sets. The baseline model, a CNN with Conv2D layers and ReLU activation, struggles with overfitting, particularly in distinguishing viral pneumonia. An improved model using data augmentation, different optimizers, and hyperparameter tuning showed some improvements but still faced overfitting issues. Transfer learning with VGG16 and ResNet models achieved higher accuracy but also suffered from overfitting, highlighting the challenge in achieving robust classification across all classes.
